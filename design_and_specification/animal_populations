After biome and river/lakes generation, animal populations should be placed.
Abstractly, the population should be a mapping `(usize,usize) -> {Animal}.

As `Animal` would likely be a small set, a set of animals can be represented
with a an uint greater than it's size. If we use an array as a representation
for the mapping, and assume the following values:

    map dimensions of 1000 * 1000
    `Animal` cardinality of 32

then the whole mapping will take up 4 MB of space. There are also some neat tricks
available for this, since river animals, land animals and sea animals will likely be
distinct sets (river- and land animals might have some overlap), we can use the biome
information to know from which category to pull. For example, assume the cardinality
of `Animal` is 8, then `0x11` might mean `[Cow, Horse]` if the biome is a land biome,
and `[Whale, Shark]` if the biome is `Ocean`.

This can be used for all biomes really, but a few animals will likely be available in
most temperate biomes so we'll see how far this can go.
